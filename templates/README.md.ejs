This WordPress <%= type %> project was bootstrapped with [wordup](https://wordup.dev)

Happy Coding ðŸš€

## Project setup 

To setup your development server, run the following command in your project folder:

```
$ wordup install
```

or if it's already installed:

```
$ wordup start
```

Wordup uses the nodejs package.json file to save the project specific settings. 
Feel free to change the package.json file for project specific needs (e.g. webpack). 

Keep in mind: If you want to change the slug in package.json, you have to reinstall the project afterwards.

## Setup a Wordpress plugin

Essential files for your WordPress plugin:

Create a file called `<%= slug %>.php` in /src folder. 

Caution: If the essential files are not in your src folder, wordup will return an error during installation.

## Setup Wordpress theme

There are two essential files for a WordPress theme:

`style.css` file with a doctype like this:

```
/*
Theme Name: <%= name %>
Theme URI: THEME SITE HERE
Author: YOUR NAME HERE
Author URI: YOUR SITE HERE
Description: PLUGIN DESCRIPTION HERE
Version: 0.1.0
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Tags: YOUR TAGS HERE
Text Domain: <%= slug %>
*/
```

`index.php` file with the basic template for your theme.
