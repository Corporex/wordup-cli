This WordPress <%= type %> project was bootstrapped with [wordup](https://wordup.dev)

Happy Coding üöÄ

## Project setup 

To setup your development server, run the following command in your project folder:

```
$ wordup install
```

or if it's already installed:

```
$ wordup start
```

In your project you will find a folder called .wordup for the project specific configuration. 

### Use wordup-cli locally

You have also the option to use wordup-cli locally as a devDependency in your package.json file. 
If you want run a wordup command from your local package,  use `npx` before `wordup`. For example:

```
$ npx wordup start
```

## Fixtures

You can add fixtures to your WordPress installation. All fixtures are located in the .wordup folder:

In the .wordup/media folder you can place your media files, which you need for developing.

The .wordup/post and .wordup/page folder contain markdown files for each post/page. 
The markdown files need to have an YAML front matter block, for example:

```
---
title: My new WordPress project
author: [Optional: name of the author]
tags: [Optional: semicolon separated tags]
category: [Optional: semicolon separated categories]
menu: [Optional: semicolon separated menu names] 
featured_image: [Optional: A file in your media folder]
---

#Headline

A text
```

## Config

The wordup config is located in .wordup/config.yml. Feel free to change the config.yml file for project specific needs. 

An advanced config file with 2 users and one custom user role looks like this:

```yaml
# Your other project settings
wpInstall:
  title: My WordPress installation
  language: en_US
  version: latest
  users:
  - name: admin
    password: 123456
    email: admin@example.com
    role: administrator
  - name: editorName
    password: 123456
    email: editor@example.com
    role: custom_role
  roles:
    - name: A Custom editor role
      key: custom_role
      clone_from: editor
      capabilities:
        - view_products
        - read_products
        - build_products
```

Notes: 
* The first user in your config.yml will always be assigned as site owner.
* Changes in configs and fixtures are only visible after executing `wordup install`

## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

DON'T delete this <%= type %> in the WP-Admin, you will lose your src files.

That's why we also recommend to use a VCS like Git.

<% if (type == 'plugin') { %>
## Setup a WordPress plugin

Essential files for your WordPress plugin:

Create a file called `<%= slug %>.php` in /src folder with a doctype like this:

```
/**
 * Plugin Name:     <%= name %>
 * Plugin URI:      PLUGIN SITE HERE
 * Description:     PLUGIN DESCRIPTION HERE
 * Author:          YOUR NAME HERE
 * Author URI:      YOUR SITE HERE
 * Text Domain:     <%= slug %>
 * Domain Path:     /languages
 * Version:         0.1.0
 *
 * @package         <%= slug %>
 */
```

<% } %>

<% if (type == 'theme') { %>
## Setup WordPress theme

There are two essential files for a WordPress theme:

`style.css` file with a doctype like this:

```
/*
Theme Name: <%= name %>
Theme URI: THEME SITE HERE
Author: YOUR NAME HERE
Author URI: YOUR SITE HERE
Description: THEME DESCRIPTION HERE
Version: 0.1.0
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Tags: YOUR TAGS HERE
Text Domain: <%= slug %>
*/
```

`index.php` file with the basic template for your theme.
<% } %>

## Add your own containers

Because wordup is based on docker-compose, it's possible to extend a project with containers of your choice. 
If you want to integrate for example phpMyAdmin, you just have to create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in the root folder of your project, with this content:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    restart: always
    environment:
      - PMA_HOST=db
      - PMA_USER=wordpress
      - PMA_PASSWORD=wordpress
    ports:
      - 8080:80
```

That's it, all your wordup commands will stay the same. But now also phpMyAdmin is running on port 8080, when you start your project servers.
