This WordPress <%= type %> project was bootstrapped with [wordup](https://wordup.dev)

Happy Coding üöÄ

## Project setup 

To setup your development server, run the following command in your project folder:

```
$ wordup install
```

or if it's already installed:

```
$ wordup start
```

Wordup uses the nodejs package.json file to save the project specific settings. 
Feel free to change the package.json file for project specific needs (e.g. webpack). 

Keep in mind: If you want to change the slug in package.json, you have to reinstall the project afterwards.

### Use wordup-cli locally

You have also the option to use wordup-cli locally as a devDependency in your package.json file. 
If you want run a wordup command from your local package,  use `npx` before `wordup`. For example:

```
$ npx wordup start
```

## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

DON'T delete this <%= type %> in the WP-Admin, you will lose your src files.

That's why we also recommend to use a VCS like Git.

Essential files for your WordPress plugin:

Create a file called `<%= slug %>.php` in /src folder with a doctype like this:
